        <li>Lower heat to low and add marinara sauce. If you want the lasagna to be extra saucy, I suggest adding more

            on
            top of the sauce. Spread each noodle wih parmesan ricotta cheese filling and sprinkle with 1 cup of
            mozzarella
            cheese and meat sauce. Repeat. Finish with remaining mozzarella cheese. </li>
        <li>Spray a large piece of foil with non-stick cooking spray and cover the lasagna. Bake for 15 minutes and then
            remove the foil. Continue to bake until the cheese if bubbling, about 25 minutes longer. Coli the lasagna

            minutes before cutting into pieces. </li>
