    <p>Nothing screams "Thanksgiving" quite like a picturesque roast turkey worthy of a Norman Rockwell painting. Believe it or not, an impossibly gorgeous holiday table of your dreams is within reach — learn exactly how to roast a turkey with this easy recipe.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (18 pound) whole turkey</li>
        <li>8 cups prepared stuffing</li>
        <li>½ cup unsalted butter, softened</li>
        <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1 ½ quarts turkey stock, divided</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Instructions:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients. Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Place a rack in the lowest position of the oven.</li>
        <li>Remove turkey neck and giblets. Rinse turkey and pat dry with paper towels, and place breast-side up, on a rack in a roasting pan.</li>
        <li>Loosely fill turkey cavity with stuffing. Rub skin with butter, then season with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Pour 2 cups of turkey stock into the roasting pan.</li>
        <li>Loosely tent turkey with aluminum foil, and roast turkey for 2 1/2 hours, basting with pan juices every 30 minutes. When drippings evaporate, add remaining stock to the pan, 1 to 2 cups at a time.</li>
        <li>Remove foil and continue roasting until a meat thermometer inserted in thickest part of thigh reads 165 degrees F (75 degrees C), about 1 1/2 hours more.</li>
        <li>Transfer turkey to a large serving platter. Let stand for 20 to 30 minutes before carving.</li>
    </ol>
