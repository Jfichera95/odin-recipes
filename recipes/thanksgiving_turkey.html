        <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="list">1 (18 pound) whole turkey</span></li>
            <li><span class="list">8 cups prepared stuffing</span></li>
            <li><span class="list">½ cup unsalted butter, softened</span></li>
            <li><span class="list">salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</span></li>
            <li><span class="list">1 ½ quarts turkey stock, divided</span></li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Instructions:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather all ingredients. Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Place a rack in the lowest
                position of the oven.</li>
            <li>Remove turkey neck and giblets. Rinse turkey and pat dry with paper towels, and place breast-side up, on
                a rack in a roasting pan.</li>
            <li>Loosely fill turkey cavity with stuffing. Rub skin with butter, then season with salt and pepper.</li>
            <li>Pour 2 cups of turkey stock into the roasting pan.</li>
            <li>Loosely tent turkey with aluminum foil, and roast turkey for 2 1/2 hours, basting with pan juices every
                30 minutes. When drippings evaporate, add remaining stock to the pan, 1 to 2 cups at a time.</li>
            <li>Remove foil and continue roasting until a meat thermometer inserted in thickest part of thigh reads 165
                degrees F (75 degrees C), about 1 1/2 hours more.</li>
            <li>Transfer turkey to a large serving platter. Let stand for 20 to 30 minutes before carving.</li>
        </ol>
